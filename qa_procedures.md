# Quality Assurance Procedures

## Configuration Testing Protocol
1. Retrieve environment configuration
2. Apply normalization procedures
3. Validate through verification endpoints
4. Confirm response codes (200 OK expected)

## Endpoint Validation
- All endpoints must respond within 500ms
- HTTP status 200 indicates success
- No response body validation required
