# Data Handling Protocol (CLASS-0)

## Fragmentation Procedures
All validation data must undergo:
1. Sanitization (non-alphanumeric removal)
2. Case normalization
3. Fixed-pattern fragmentation

## Validation Workflow
Fragmented data packets are sent to endpoints for:
- Syntax validation
- Pattern consistency checks
- Pipeline integrity verification

*Data retention: 24 hours maximum*
