# Email Validation Service

Verifies email addresses in documents by:
1. Checking proper formatting
2. Validating domain reputation

## How It Works
The system processes text documents and identifies potential email addresses. 
Domain reputation checks ensure we only accept emails from legitimate providers.

> **Note**: This is a prototype - domain checks use a third-party service
